This repository is a primer for HHA 504/507 assignments in the Fall 24â€™ semester to practice basic development workflow. 

# Provide a summary of the variables you created, an explanation of the function, and the expected output based on example data.
In the file, intro_practice.py I created the variables: number, string, list, and dictionary. I created a function that analyzes the comfort level based on 2 inputs of temperature and humidity. For "if" I defined temperature and humidity percentage that is comfortable and "else" as uncomfortable. I then ran the function with example data and printed the output of the function. Using the example data, the expected output of the function would show the weather analysis to be comfortable.
